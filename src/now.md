# Now

> Updated 1st May 2020

Right now, the entire world is in lockdown. The pandemic has meant that I've found a bit
more extra time to dig back into electronics. Specifically, I'm building a diy synth.

Also, working from home for [Axminster Tools](https://axminstertools.com). Life is slow,
but I'm rather enjoying that.
