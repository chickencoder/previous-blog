1. Eleventy

- Frustrated with React solutions (too heavy)
- It's nice to write HTML templates and not just JavaScript

2. TailwindCSS

- It's so nice
- Instant API for your design system
- Themeable
- PurgeCSS
- Dark mode plugin

3. Netlify

- Been using for 3 years now. went to JAMStack Conf in London. Stickers mean I feel I must use product.
- Instant TLS/SSL Certificate
- Netlify DNS is awesome
- GitHub integration

In closing

- Really nice lighthouse scores
